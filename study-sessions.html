								<h2>TEA Group Study Sessions</h2>
								<p>Study with your peers and get free help from a tutor</p>
							</header>
							<p>Texas Economics Association proudly offers free, drop-in, group study sessions for entry-level Economics classes. These sessions are held several times a week and are a great place to meet other people in your class, collaborate on homework, study for exams, and receive <strong>free help from a qualified tutor</strong>. Being a member of TEA is <span class="underline">not</span> required. Think of it as our way of giving back to the University of Texas economics community that has given us so much.</p>
							<h3 class="underline">Fall 2016 Study Session Schedule</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Econ Stats: </strong> Every Monday from 5-6 in BRB 1.120</li>

							<p>An up-to-date schedule is always available on the <a href="calendar.html">TEA calendar</a>. Answers to some common questions are available below, but if you still want more info please email the <a href="mailto:academics@texaseconomics.org">TEA academic committee</a> and someone will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
							
							<p><strong>What exactly is a study session?</strong><br>
							Everyone comes into college thinking they can take on the world on their own, but the truth is everyone needs a support system to succeed. Our study sessions provide that support in a casual setting. Think of study sessions as hanging out with your friends and doing homework, because that is exactly what they are.
							<br><br>
							Our study sessions are hosted by members of the TEA academic committee who have graciously volunteered their time to provide leadership to the groups on a particular subject. When you come to a study session you can either come with specific questions in mind or you can just come and do your homework with the knowledge that there are people around to help out if you need it.
							<br><br>
							Sometimes your professor can tell you something fifty different ways, but it isn't until you hear it explained by a peer that you really get it. You are going to do your homework anyway, so there is no reason not to do it with us. You might even make some new friends!</p>
							
							<p><strong>What's the catch?</strong><br>
							No catch. No strings attached. Our study sessions are absolutely free to everyone. You don't have to be in Texas Economics Association (or even be an economics major) to attend. Come to just one session or visit us every week. Stay for five minutes or the whole session. The choice is yours and there is no need to RSVP ahead of time. We call them "drop-in" sessions for a reason.
							<br><br>
							So why do we volunteer our time to do this? Mostly, the members of the TEA academic committee genuinely like helping people and we enjoy seeing people succeed in their courses. We do hope your will our study sessions so much that you will think about <a href="join-tea.html">joining Texas Economics Association</a>, but we won't be offended if you don't. We will still welcome with open arms at our study sessions.</p>
